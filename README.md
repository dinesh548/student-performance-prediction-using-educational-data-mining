# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction Using Educational Data Mining

An interactive Streamlit web application that predicts student performance using machine learning models (RandomForest and LinearRegression).  
This project was developed as part of a final year university submission, applying **educational data mining techniques**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Upload your own dataset or use synthetic data generated in-app.
- Train ML models on the fly with scaling and train-test split.
- Display model metrics (Mean Absolute Error, R²).
- Interactive visualizations with Plotly.
- Real-time predictions via sidebar inputs.
- Feature importance analysis (RandomForest).
